# CLI-InventoryManagement

## Introduction
My idea for this project was to build a mock Inventory Management System to enable me to start working with databases. At the time of working on this project, I am taking a class on System Design 
and we have delved a little bit into databases and it inspired me to to take the dive into a more hands on method of learning. I chose Java as the language because I have worked with it across my
highschool and college career thus far and I have found that I greatly enjoy Object Oriented Programming! 

## Goals
- Learn to create and use relational databases such as PostgreSQL
    - Creating normalized schemas
    - Writing queries in SQL
    - Gaining understanding of CRUD operations
- Continue to practice implemetning good object oriented design in Java
    - Practicing important OOP concepts like encapsulation and absratction with classes such as Product and ProductDAO.
- Learning how to interact with databases
    - Learning how to use JDBC and PreparedStatement to safely exceute SQL queries and updates
    - Creating maintainable easy to read code
